        <h1>Welcome to the Make to Learn CAD Model Repository</h1>
        <p>
          The educational effectiveness of fabrication tools in K-12 maker
          spaces is enhanced by access to useful Computer-Assisted Design (CAD)
          models and associated instructional materials. Beginning in 2010, a
          series of curated CAD models were developed through three successive
          NSF grants (NSF #1030865, 151308, 1842342). Educational CAD models
          created through these efforts are housed in this repository.
          Contributors include educational associations, fabrication
          laboratories, community college technical programs, maker spaces in
          K-12 schools, and non-profit institutions. All of the 3D CAD models
          and associated instructional materials are made publicly available and
          licensed under a:

          The models in the Invention Kit Repository were developed through
          collaboration with the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American
          History. These kits and instructional materials enable students to
          reconstruct transformational inventions in the collections of the
          Smithsonian Institution.

        <p>
          The Papercraft Models were developed over the past decade by a math
          teacher, Elaine Wolfe. During the past ten years, she has developed
          more than 300 papercraft models designed for fabrication by digital
          die cutters such as the Silhouette and the Cricut.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joseph Henry taught at Princeton before becoming the first founding
          secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. The models from this
          collection enable students to reconstruct inventions and scientific
          apparatus that Joseph Henry developed for teaching at Princeton.
        </p>

          The MathHappens Foundation is dedicated to creating math models and
          supporting development of mathematical experiences. The foundation
          supports use of models by teachers from all disciplines.

          The repositories listed above were created through collaborations with
          these external contributors and with other associations that include
          the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators, the Association for
          Science Teacher Education, and the International Technology and
          Engineering Education Association. We are interested in collaborating
          with other nonprofit associations dedicated to development of 3D CAD
          models and related instructional materials designed for use in K-12
          makerspaces. For further information, please contact us at
